This is complex_qtango_demo README file.

This is a demo QTango project that can be used to test the qtangoprojectwizard import
procedure to convert an application from QTango to cumbia.
See the tutorial page from the cumbia documentation:

file:///usr/local/share/doc/qumbia-tango-controls/html/tutorial_from_qtango.html

This application reads the "double_scalar" attribute from the TangoTest device
and the State and Status commands.
A push button can be used to switch the Tango state.
A TApplyNumeric, a dial and a slider can be used to write the same "double_scalar" attribute on the device.


DEPENDENCIES:

Qt 	version >= 4.8
Qwt 	version 6
QTango  version 6
